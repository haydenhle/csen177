1. log in the same way as lab 6
2. cd /usr/src/kernel
3. go into file proc.c and open in text editor
4. go to function pick_proc and edit the for loop. add 
int random; //outside the for loop

// after the if inside the for
random = rand() % 100;
if (random < 20)
	continue;

5. save and go to /usr/src in VM and make world
6. reboot to see it takes substantially longer than before
